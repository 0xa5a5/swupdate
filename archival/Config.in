config CPIO
	bool "cpio"
	default y
	help
	  cpio is an archival utility program used to create, modify, and
	  extract contents from archives.
	  cpio has 110 bytes of overheads for every stored file.

	  This implementation of cpio can extract cpio archives created in the
	  "newc" or "crc" format, it cannot create or modify them.

	  Unless you have a specific application which requires cpio, you
	  should probably say N here.

config GUNZIP
	bool "gunzip"
	default y
	depends on HAVE_ZLIB
	help
	  gunzip is used to decompress archives created by gzip.
	  You can use the `-t' option to test the integrity of
	  an archive, without decompressing it.
